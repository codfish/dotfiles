/* Utility to add a margin-right to an element to compensate for the scrollbar being hidden. */
/* Should only apply to desktop devices, so we're using media queries to target them. */
@layer utilities {
  @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
    .mr-scrollbar-hidden {
      margin-right: 0.75rem;
    }
  }
}

/* An even better way to do this is to use the `@custom-variant` directive. */
@custom-variant desktop-only (@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine));

/* Then in markup, you can use it like this: <div class="desktop-only:mr-3"> */
